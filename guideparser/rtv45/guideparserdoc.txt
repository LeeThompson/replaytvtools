To use: 

Run ReplayPC or another suitable program to download the guide from the Replay.   The file is typically called "guide.dat".

Run GuideParser with the parameters you want against the guide, by default output will go to STDOUT.    

e.g. 

From a Command Prompt:

replaypc 192.168.0.7 -g
guideparser -f guide.dat > temp.txt
notepad temp.txt





If for any reason GuideParser crashes or shows incorrect data:

1. Make sure you are only using a guide from a Replay 5000 model running 4.5.   This version of GuideParser will not operate properly with Replay 4000 or 4500 series models.
2. Use WINZIP or another archiving program to archive the guide.dat file and send it to me with a note stating what error or incorrect data was seen.
