ReplayTV tools are a collection of command line utilities to work with MPEG-2
streams for the ReplayTV 5000 series Personal Video Recorder.   This document
also refers to another third party software package called "DVArchive"  which
is  a  Java  based  application for  downloading video from  a  ReplayTV  and 
streaming video back to one (along other things).

These tools will allow you to do the following: 

* Edit downloaded shows without reencoding; stream them with DVArchive
* Convert RTV files for use with DVD Authoring
* Convert RTV4K MPEGs for streaming to a RTV5K
* Convert MPEG-2 streams and stream to a RTV5K with DVArchive
